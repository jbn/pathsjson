Implementations
===============

The [reference implementation](https://github.com/jbn/pathsjson) is in python.
Install it via, 

```sh
pip install pathsjson
```

However, I ***hope*** programmers who find it useful will implement it in 
their favorite languages. It's not a complicated package, and I purposely made
the implementation simple and readable. If you write your own implementation,
please feel free to add it to the list below.
